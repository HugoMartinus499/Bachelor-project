Repository for 2024 Bachelor Project in Cognitive Science. 

## Is democracy the best choice?
The aim of this project is to shine a light on democracy and alternatives and comparing them to each other.
This is done by making an Agent-Based Model to simulate the effects of governance in several different political systems

## Todo
- [:heavy_check_mark:] Set up turtle to turtle information exchange mechanism
- [x] Adjust information brackets (size of population)
- [x] Install values according to preferences based on information brackets
- [x] Change information level adjustment by reaching peaks
- [x] Make turtle-turtle exchange probabilistic
- [x] Make information-bracket opinions more random and numeric
- [x] Make opinions random inside each bracket. Eg. information-level 75-100, random number between 1 and 40 on government intervention
- [x] Make the above subject to change according to information-level change
- [x] Add a CSV reading script for when the simulations are saved
- [x] Add weight of different opinions. Some people will value economics more when voting, some people will value education etc.
- [x] Look to MateSelection ABM for Voter-Candidate interaction
- [ ] Look into real policies and determine numeric value for parameters for each candidate
- [ ] Change output to reflect both information level and both yes and no answers
- [ ] Factor in weight when choosing candidate
- [ ] Run NetLogo ABM sufficient times
